                <h2>The Mission</h2>
                <p>MAXOUT is a tournament series through and through but there is no tournament without any players. We recognize that it can be daunting for someone coming to their first tournament but we strongly encourgae players at any skill level, even ones that haven't ever picked up a controller, to come on out and play. If the size of MAXOUT is the scariest part you can come on out to the weekly tournaments Top in the Shop and Top in the Shop [EX] to get a closer look at the scene and get some training time in with any of our instructors and for any game you might be interested in.
                    <br />Lets meet just a few of these instructors</p>

                    <h3>Street Fighter</h3>
                    <p>
                        From throwing your first Hadouken to the complexities of conditioning your opponents and understanding frame data, Robbie has you covered. Robbie has mentored a large portion of the scene and continues to give advice and tips to even the best players in the KCFGC, He excels at bringing new people into the fold and helping them feel welcomed. Robbie is considered by many to be the father of the current KCFGC and was mentored himself by an older Street Fighter player not just in the game but in being the figure head for the rest of us. "The worst thing you can do when it comes to a fighting game is not pick up a controller"

                    <h3>Skullgirls</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chris Cunningham is a multiple time top 8 finisher in Skullgirls and now works for Hidden Variable (the studio working on Skullgirls). Chris plays many games but his all time favorite is Skullgirls, from headless Fortune mixups to asking for Peacock nerfs he is the man to guide you through your journey in the game that just won't quit. If DHC's and touch of deaths with cute hand drawn anime girls is your speed look no further. "So they say I can't enter major tournaments anymore because I work on it but do you think that applys to....."

                    <p>
                        Darryl (DJ) Jones is a relatively new player but that doesn't stop him from throwing hands with the absolute best. Kansas City has some nationally recognized talen in Tekken and plenty of players to learn from, DJ is one that has continually improved himself and the players around him. After conquering bracket demons and placing highly in tournaments he still continues to push forward and strive for progress. "I'll probably play Tekken until the day I die'"
