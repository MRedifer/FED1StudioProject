            <article id="aboutUs">


                <p>
                    The modern version of the KCFGC actually originated a little over a decade ago. After the "dark ages" (the period of time when fighting game releases had come to a crawl before Street Fighter IV's launch')
                    a fighting game scene had developed to put a little fire into the "old school" players located in KC. This small scene was in Oak Grove Missouri and was being helmed by Robbie Votaw, who had stumbled upon a new
                    local card shop called Pew Pew Card and Games. It was here that he would build his local scene from next to nothing with the help of KC's head tournament organizer Jonathan Spotswood and breed fighting game players
                    to rival the long time players of Kansas City. All of that happened well over 10 years ago and now the two scenes have assimilated and evolved into a welcoming community geared towards raising everyone up and
                    competing on the national level. "The worst thing you can do when it comes to fighting games is never pick up a controller" - Robbie Votaw
