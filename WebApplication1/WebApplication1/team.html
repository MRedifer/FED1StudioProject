        <h3>Robbie (RobbieV) Votaw</h3>
        <p>
            Robbie has mentored a large portion of the scene and continues to give advice and tips to even the best players in the KCFGC, He excels at bringing new people into the fold and helping them feel welcomed. Robbie is considered by many to be the father of the current KCFGC and was mentored himself by an older Street Fighter player not just in the game but in being the figure head for the rest of us. He used to edit the nightly news for KMBC 9 and has transfered those skills over to the scene by providing top quality edits and bumps for all the streams we have. "The worst thing you can do when it comes to a fighting game is not pick up a controller"

        <h3>Chris (Fullbleed) Cunningham</h3>
        <p>
            Chris Cunningham is a multiple time top 8 finisher in Skullgirls and now works for Hidden Variable (the studio working on Skullgirls). Chris plays many games but his all time favorite is Skullgirls, finishing top 8 at majors such as Frosty Faustings, CEO, and Combo Breaker multiple times. He is a well known and well liked person within the national Skullgirls community and now he even works on the game! Working for the studio that develops the game means he can't compete in sponsored tournaments or circuits anymore but that isn't stopping him. Being able to work on the game you care so much for was a dream of his he was able to make come true. "So they say I can't enter major tournaments anymore because I work on it but do you think that applys to....."

        <h3>Darryl (Springs02) Jones</h3>
        <p>
            Darryl Jones is a relatively new player but that doesn't stop him from throwing hands with the absolute best. Kansas City has some nationally recognized talen in Tekken and plenty of players to learn from, DJ is one that has continually improved himself and the players around him. After conquering bracket demons and placing highly in tournaments he still continues to push forward and strive for progress. We have watched him continually climb the tournament placements and body people online, if only we could get him to eat his vegetables. "Y'all really just eat broccoli like that huh"

        <h3>Riley (Riles_Barkley) Stark</h3>
        <p>
            Riley Stark is one of the higher level Street Fighter players in the scene. He loves picking up new characters and grinding ranked matches with them. Shortly before the pandemic he lost a pivotal match to TKC_Redifer at a maxout and decided that it was time to put some work in so that would never happen again. He started training relentlessly and at the end of the lockdown came out in one of the highest rankings online, AND THEN did it again after the release of Luke. "Check out this sick combo...... No it's not optimal, just watch"
